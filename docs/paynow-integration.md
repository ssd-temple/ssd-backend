# PayNow (DBS PayNow Corporate) Integration

Status: **code implemented, running on HEB's borrowed DBS credentials — NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION until swapped for SSD's own.** See [Current status & what's borrowed](#current-status--whats-borrowed) before doing anything with this beyond local dev/testing.

This mirrors HEB's own working Payment-Service implementation
(`D:\PROJECTS\HEB\Payment-Service\source\controllers\paynow`) as closely as
possible, adapted to SSD-Backend's single-entity POS flow
(`controllers/pos-orders`, `models/pos-orders` / `pos-bookings` /
`pos-transactions`).

## How the whole flow works

PayNow QR payment is **two completely separate, asynchronous steps** — this
is the single most important thing to understand about it:

1. **QR generation** builds a QR code image AND fixes the amount that
   payment will confirm. This talks to DBS itself **only** if
   `PAYNOW_QR_ENGINE=java` (the certified path, see below) — either way, no
   network call happens for the QR image itself. What actually happens:
   `controllers/pos-orders`' `createPendingPayment()` resolves/validates the
   amount (the requested amount, or the full outstanding balance), cancels
   any earlier still-open QR for the same order, and writes a
   `pos_transactions` row with `paymentStatus: "pending"` and that amount —
   **fixed, from this point on** — before the QR image is even built
   (`buildPaynowQrForOrder`, `controllers/pos-orders/index.js`). Generating a
   QR is still not a payment (nothing is marked `"paid"` here, and a
   customer could generate ten QRs — each cancelling the last — and pay
   none of them).

   This runs from **two places**, sharing the same `buildPaynowQrForOrder`:
   - **The order's very first payment** — `POST /pos/booking/orders`
     (`controllers/pos-orders`' `createOrder`) builds the QR itself, right
     inside that same request, and returns it embedded as
     `paymentDetails: { amount, qr, engine }` in the order-create response.
     The POS counter never has to make a second call just to see a QR for a
     brand new PayNow order. If QR-building fails (config incomplete, a
     render error), the order itself is still created and returned —
     `paymentDetails` comes back `null` and `paymentDetailsError` names
     why, so the frontend can fall back to the standalone route below with
     the order's `referenceId` rather than losing the order (and its
     inventory hold) outright.
   - **A top-up against an already-confirmed booking** —
     `POST /payments/paynow/generate-qr` (`controllers/payments/paynow/
     generate-qr/index.js`) — there's no order-create response to embed a
     QR into at that point (BookingSuccessView's "Pay Again"), so this
     standalone route is still what the frontend calls directly.

2. **Payment confirmation** — either **DBS itself**, calling
   `POST /api/v1/payments/paynow/icn-response` with an encrypted "Instant
   Credit Notification" (ICN) once the customer actually scans and pays, OR
   an admin manually confirming the same pending payment from the **POS
   Order Confirmation** admin screen (`controllers/pos-order-confirmation`)
   when a real webhook can't reach this server (e.g. `localhost` in local
   dev). Both call the exact same `confirmPosPayment()` — genuinely the
   same code path, not two parallel ones — and **neither gets to choose a
   different amount than the one createPendingPayment() already fixed**;
   they can only confirm it, the same way a Cash cashier can't "confirm" a
   receipt for more than what was rung up. The admin screen's own form
   accordingly has no amount field at all — see that module's own comment
   and its reference, HEB's Admin-Frontend, which renders this amount
   read-only in every one of its own equivalent confirm screens.

    |                                |                                 |

    |  <-- "confirmed" ---------------|                                 |
```

The POS frontend never learns "payment succeeded" from the QR-generation
call — it has to poll `GET /pos/booking/orders/:id/status` (already built,
see `controllers/pos-orders`) until the ICN webhook has landed and flipped
the order to `confirmed`. This is exactly the same pattern Cash already
uses today, just with the confirmation arriving from DBS instead of
happening synchronously in the same request.

## What correlates a QR to a payment

Every QR is generated for one `pos_order`'s 13-character `referenceId`
(e.g. `POS8N7J3QNPS4` — see `common/utils/payment-reference.js`). That same
id is embedded **inside** the QR's data as the transaction reference
(`Event_Order_Ref_No`), and DBS echoes it straight back in the ICN payload
as `txnInfo.customerReference`. That's the only thread connecting "a QR was
scanned and paid" to "which order this was for" — there is no other
correlation mechanism. See `controllers/pos-orders`' `confirmPosPayment()`
for what happens once that id comes back:

1. Finds the order's one active `pos_transactions` row with
   `paymentStatus: "pending"` — `createPendingPayment()` guarantees there's
   never more than one at a time.
2. If a `gatewayReference` (`txnRefId`) already recorded on a `"paid"` row
   matches, this is a duplicate callback — returns immediately as a no-op.
3. If the pending row has passed its own `expiresAt` (15 minutes from
   generation), marks it `"expired"` and refuses — a fresh QR is needed.
4. If an `amount` was given (a real gateway reporting its own figure), it
   must match the pending row's fixed amount, or this throws — the
   confirmation can attest to the fixed amount, never change it.
5. Atomically claims the row (`findOneAndUpdate` guarded on
   `paymentStatus: "pending"`) — this is what makes a race between two
   near-simultaneous confirmations for the same row safe: whichever loses
   the atomic update sees it match nothing and reports back as already
   processed instead of double-confirming.
6. Resolves whether this is the order's first payment (still pending —
   writes the `pos_booking` now) or a top-up (already confirmed — just
   recomputes the booking's `paymentStatus` from every paid transaction).

The **POS Order Confirmation** admin screen
(`controllers/pos-order-confirmation`) is the manual stand-in for step 2
when no real DBS webhook reaches this server — it calls this exact same
`confirmPosPayment()`, just with an admin-entered `gatewayReference`
instead of one DBS supplied, and (deliberately) no amount input at all.

## What details a QR generation payload actually needs

`controllers/payments/paynow/generate-qr` builds the QR from these fields
(all currently read from `config/env.js`, sourced from `.env`):

| Field | What it is | Merchant-specific? |
|---|---|---|
| `PAYNOW_MERCHANT_CATEGORY_CODE` | DBS-assigned 4-digit MCC | Yes |
| `PAYNOW_TXN_CURRENCY` | ISO 4217 numeric currency code (`702` = SGD) | No — fixed for SG |
| `PAYNOW_COUNTRY_CODE` | `SG` | No — fixed for SG |
| `PAYNOW_MERCHANT_NAME` | Display name shown in the payer's banking app | Yes |
| `PAYNOW_MERCHANT_CITY` | `Singapore` | No |
| `PAYNOW_GLOBAL_UNIQUE_ID` | `SG.PAYNOW` — identifies the QR as following the SG PayNow scheme | No — spec constant |
| `PAYNOW_PROXY_TYPE` | What kind of proxy `PAYNOW_PROXY_VALUE` is (`2` = UEN) | Depends on registration type |
| `PAYNOW_PROXY_VALUE` | **The actual UEN/proxy DBS registered — this is what determines which bank account gets paid** | **Yes — the critical one** |
| `PAYNOW_EDITABLE_AMOUNT` | Whether the payer can change the amount (`1`/`0`) | Merchant choice |
| `PAYNOW_POINT_OF_INITIATION` | EMVCo static/dynamic QR flag | Merchant choice, usually fixed per integration |
| `PAYNOW_QR_COLOR_CODE` | Cosmetic QR accent color | Cosmetic only |
| the order's `referenceId` | Embedded as `Event_Order_Ref_No` | Generated per-order, not config |
| the order's amount | The `Total_Amount` argument | Resolved server-side from the order/booking, never trusted from the client |

The amount is **always resolved server-side** (`resolveOutstandingBalance()`
in `generate-qr/index.js`) from the `pos_order`/`pos_booking`'s own
`grandTotal` minus what's already been paid — the same principle
`createOrder`/`confirmOrder` already apply for Cash. An `amount` in the
request body is accepted only to request a **partial** payment (clamped to
the outstanding balance), never to inflate it.

## What the ICN webhook needs

`controllers/payments/paynow/icn-response` needs to **decrypt and verify**
DBS's notification before trusting anything in it — this is the actual
authentication mechanism for this endpoint (it's mounted unauthenticated;
only someone holding DBS's real signing key could produce a message our
key verifies). That needs:

- **Our own PGP private key** (to decrypt) — `public/Paynowsdk/dbs-paynow-private-SECRET.asc`
- **DBS's PGP public key** (to verify the signature) — `public/Paynowsdk/dbs-paynow-public-uat.asc` (or `-live.asc`)

Both are currently HEB's own keys, borrowed — see below.

## Current status & what's borrowed

Everything below is copied from HEB's own live `.env` / key files, exactly
as asked, so this code path can be exercised end-to-end before SSD's own
DBS paperwork is done. **None of it is safe to use for a real payment**:

- `PAYNOW_MERCHANT_NAME=HINDU ENDOWMENTS BOARD` and `PAYNOW_PROXY_VALUE=T08GB0016CH02`
  are HEB's own registered identity — if a real customer ever scanned a QR
  generated with these, **the money would go to HEB's bank account**, not
  SSD's, regardless of what the app or receipt says.
- The PGP key pair is HEB's own DBS-issued keys.
- `PAYNOW_CREDENTIALS_ARE_SSD_OWN=false` in `.env` reflects this.
  `assertPaynowConfigured()` (`generate-qr/render.js`) refuses to run the
  **`java` engine** at all if `NODE_ENV=production` while this stays
  `false` — this is the one safety net stopping a forgotten swap from
  silently going live on HEB's identity through DBS's actual certified
  pipeline. **Do not remove or bypass this check.** Flip
  `PAYNOW_CREDENTIALS_ARE_SSD_OWN` to `true` only once every value in the
  table above, and both key files, are genuinely SSD's own. The **`dummy`
  engine** (the default — see below) is deliberately exempt from this guard:
  it never talks to DBS's certified pipeline at all, so it's safe to run in
  any environment, including a Render deployment's `NODE_ENV=production`,
  purely to demo/test the POS flow end-to-end before SSD's own DBS
  onboarding is done.
- `MERCHANT_NAME` is left as HEB's real name (not relabelled "Sri Siva Durga
  Temple") deliberately — displaying SSD's name while the money still
  routes to HEB's account would be more actively misleading than leaving it
  honestly HEB-branded while this is admittedly a borrowed test setup.

### Two files still need to be placed manually

Copying HEB's key material was blocked by this session's safety
guardrails (copying a real private key across two different clients'
codebases is exactly the kind of action that should get a human's eyes on
it, not an agent's). You'll need to copy these three files yourself from
`D:\PROJECTS\HEB\Payment-Service\public\Paynowsdk\` into
`SSD-Backend\public\Paynowsdk\`, renaming as shown (the code already
expects these exact names):

| Source (HEB) | Destination (SSD-Backend) |
|---|---|
| `HebPayment_Private_SECRET.asc` | `dbs-paynow-private-SECRET.asc` |
| `HEBPaymentUAT_public.asc` | `dbs-paynow-public-uat.asc` |
| `HebPaymentLive_Public.asc` | `dbs-paynow-public-live.asc` (optional — UAT is the default, see `PAYNOW_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`) |
| `sample-response.asc` | `sample-response.asc` (optional — a sample encrypted ICN payload, useful for a manual local decrypt test) |

These are already git-ignored in this repo (`.gitignore` —
`public/Paynowsdk/dbs-paynow-*.asc`), unlike HEB's own repo which does
track them — see the `.gitignore` comment for why that's a deliberate
difference. The QR SDK jar, its `lib/` dependencies, and `PayNow.png` are
**not** secret and are already copied + tracked normally.

### Also still needed: install the new dependency

`openpgp` was added to `package.json` but the actual install
(`pnpm install`) was also blocked by this session's guardrails (installing
a new package is treated the same way). Run `pnpm install` before starting
the server — until then, anything that touches the ICN webhook path will
fail with `Cannot find module 'openpgp'`.

## What to ask SSD's own DBS PayNow contact for

When SSD's own DBS PayNow Corporate onboarding happens, everything in the
table above needs SSD's own value. Concretely, ask DBS (or whichever bank
issues SSD's PayNow Corporate service) for:

1. **The PayNow proxy ID** DBS issues for SSD's registered UEN — this is
   the single most important item; it's what `PAYNOW_PROXY_VALUE` becomes,
   and it's what actually determines whose bank account gets paid.
2. **SSD's Merchant Category Code (MCC)**.
3. **The exact registered merchant/legal entity name** DBS has on file for
   SSD (goes into `PAYNOW_MERCHANT_NAME`, shown to every payer).
4. **The QR-generation SDK/library** DBS issues for SSD's own program —
   confirm it's the same `PayQRSDK.jar` (Java) HEB uses, or get whatever
   SSD's own is. This also means confirming **a Java runtime needs to be
   installed on whatever server runs SSD-Backend** (see
   `generate-qr/find-java.js`).
5. **The "Global Unique ID"** DBS issues (likely `SG.PAYNOW` again — this
   is a scheme constant, not merchant-specific, but confirm).
6. **Which point-of-initiation-method / editable-amount configuration**
   SSD is provisioned for (static vs. dynamic QR).
7. **ICN (Instant Credit Notification) webhook setup**:
   - the callback URL to register — currently
     `http://localhost:5003/api/v1/payments/paynow/icn-response` in dev
     (see `PAYNOW_ICN_RESPONSE_URL` in `.env`); this needs to become
     SSD-Backend's real public URL once deployed,
   - **DBS's own PGP public key** for SSD's environment (to verify their
     ICN signature),
   - instructions to **generate SSD's own PGP keypair** and register its
     public half with DBS (SSD's private key stays only on SSD-Backend's
     server, never sent to DBS),
   - whatever DBS puts in front of that webhook for authentication beyond
     the PGP signature itself (an API key, IP allow-list, mutual TLS —
     HEB's own reference code doesn't show one, worth asking explicitly).
8. **Separate UAT/sandbox credentials**, distinct from production, so this
   can be tested safely before it ever touches a real donor's payment.
9. If refunds matter: **a separate Refund API contract** — HEB's own
   reference implementation for this
   (`D:\PROJECTS\HEB\Payment-Service\source\controllers\refund`) is itself
   still a stub with the real DBS call commented out and a simulated
   response, so this hasn't actually been proven working even on HEB's
   side. **Not implemented for SSD at all yet** — out of scope for this
   phase.

## Files

- `src/controllers/payments/paynow/generate-qr/` — `index.js` (the standalone HTTP route, top-ups only), `render.js` (the actual QR-rendering logic + `assertPaynowConfigured`, shared with `controllers/pos-orders`' `buildPaynowQrForOrder` so a brand new order's first QR can be built in-process without a require cycle), `find-java.js`
- `src/controllers/payments/paynow/icn-response/` — the webhook (`index.js`, `decrypt-response.js`)
- `src/controllers/payments/dispatch.js` — the shared prefix-routed confirmation dispatcher both this and future payment modes (NETS) call into
- `src/controllers/payments/index.js` — routes: `POST /paynow/generate-qr` (operator-authenticated), `POST /paynow/icn-response` (public)
- `src/config/env.js` — every `PAYNOW_*` field, all empty by default (no real values hardcoded in source — see that file's own comment)
- `public/Paynowsdk/` — the QR SDK jar + brand image (tracked in git) and the DBS key material (git-ignored, currently HEB's borrowed keys)

## What's NOT implemented yet

- Refunds.
- Anything beyond the single-entity case — `PAYNOW_PROXY_VALUE` etc. are
  one fixed value; if SSD ever has multiple outlets each needing their own
  DBS proxy, this needs the same kind of per-outlet switch HEB's own
  `generate-qr` has for its multiple temples (see that file's `Temple_ID`
  switch) — not built here since SSD is single-entity today.
- Server-side enforcement of the QR's real expiry — the QR is generated
  with a 1-year validity window (matching HEB's own reference code
  exactly), but nothing here currently checks that window server-side
  before honoring an ICN; DBS itself is presumably the actual enforcement
  point for an expired QR.
