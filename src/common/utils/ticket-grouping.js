/**
 * Resolves a booking's lines into physical print tickets, per the Print
 * Split Setting master (models/print-split-settings). Pure, no I/O — every
 * input here is already-loaded/populated data, so this is unit-testable
 * without a database. The caller (controllers/pos-orders'
 * getBookingTicketGroups) owns loading the booking, the Item/Service docs,
 * and the PrintSplitSetting singleton; this file only owns the resolution
 * and grouping rules themselves, so the same tested logic can be reused by
 * a future reprint screen without re-deriving it.
 *
 * Two responsibilities, deliberately kept separate (this mirrors the
 * business rule as specified): WHICH Print Group a line belongs to is
 * resolveLineUnits()'s job; HOW those resolved units get split into tickets
 * is buildTicketGroups()'s job.
 *
 * Resolution rule:
 *   - offeringDoc.isDeityMappingRequired === true  -> one unit PER deity on
 *     the line (Deity.printingGroup). A line can carry more than one deity
 *     (posOrderLineSchema.deities is an array), and the line's own
 *     lineTotal is a single flat charge for the whole line regardless of
 *     how many deities were selected (controllers/pos-orders' createOrder
 *     computes it as unitPrice * quantity only — never multiplied by deity
 *     count). Each deity's resolved unit therefore carries an even split of
 *     that one lineTotal (splitAmountEvenly below), not the line's full
 *     amount replicated onto every deity — replicating it would make each
 *     deity's own ticket overstate what was actually charged, and a
 *     Print-Group-Wise ticket combining several of a line's deities would
 *     sum to more than the customer ever paid. Cents that don't divide
 *     evenly go to the first few deities (in selection order) so the split
 *     amounts always sum back to exactly the original lineTotal.
 *   - offeringDoc.isDeityMappingRequired === false -> exactly one unit,
 *     using offeringDoc.printingGroup directly. No deity is invented.
 *
 * Never silently drops a line: a line whose required deity/group mapping is
 * missing throws, rather than being skipped.
 */

/**
 * Splits `totalAmount` into `count` shares that sum back to exactly
 * `totalAmount` (to the cent) — a plain `totalAmount / count` would leave
 * silent rounding drift (e.g. $10 / 3 = $3.333... per share, summing to
 * $9.99 or $10.01 depending how it's later rounded). Works in integer cents
