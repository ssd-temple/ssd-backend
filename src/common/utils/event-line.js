/**
 * Event cart lines - the third kind of thing a POS/Admin cart can hold, next
 * to Items and Services. Kept in one module so the booking summary, both
 * createOrder implementations, the seat holds and the ticket printer all
 * apply exactly the same rules.
 *
 * What an Event line is:
 *   - Priced per booking (Event.salePrice, GST-inclusive like every other
 *     master), never per deity - effectiveQuantity() always returns 1 for it.
 *   - Tied to one slot when the event needs slots (isSlotRequired), chosen by
 *     `slotKey`.
 *   - Carries the deities picked from the event's own deity mapping, and -
 *     when the event asks for family members - the named devotees.
 *   - Takes SEATS from its slot: one seat per named devotee when the event
 *     asks for family members, otherwise one per booking. The seats are held
 *     from "add to cart" on and turn into booked seats when the booking is
 *     confirmed - see common/utils/event-seats.js for how that is done.
