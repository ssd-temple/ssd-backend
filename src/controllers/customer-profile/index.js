 * Customer-side, self-service. Every handler here operates on
 * `req.customer` — the profile the customerAccess middleware resolved from
 * the session — so there is no id in any of these routes to tamper with,
 * and an admin hitting them acts as themselves rather than as a devotee
 * they picked.
 *
 * Mounted at /me so the path itself states the scope — see routes/index.js.
 * Note what is absent: no requirePermission. Module permissions answer
 * "which parts of the temple's administration may this staff member touch",
 * and none of that applies to a devotee reading their own profile. The
 * authorization here is structural instead — every route resolves its
 * subject from the session, so the only record you can reach is your own.
