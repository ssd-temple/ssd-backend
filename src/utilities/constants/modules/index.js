/**
 * Single source of truth for permission module keys — the live permission
 * resolver (common/middleware/auth-guard.js), the Role Permission screen
 * (via GET /modules), and every route guard read from this list, so the
 * module tree is never hand-typed twice and drifting.
 *
 * RULE: a module key only belongs here if real routes are actually gated on
 * it. A key with no API behind it is worse than useless — it renders a
 * toggle in the Permission screen that silently grants nothing, which reads
 * to an admin as "access denied is broken". ("entities" used to sit here
 * for exactly that reason; there are no /entities routes, so it's gone
 * until the Entity Master is built.)
 *
 * Current key → route mapping:
 *   users            → GET/POST/PUT  /users
 *   customers        → GET/PUT       /customers   (admin-side devotee master;
 *                      distinct from /me/customer-profile, which is a devotee
 *                      reading their own record and needs no module grant)
 *   roles            → GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /roles, PUT /roles/:id/permissions, GET /modules
 *   email-templates  → CRUD /notifications/email-templates
 *                      CRUD /notifications/email-template-mappings
 *   cms-menus        → GET /cms/meta, CRUD /cms/menus
 *   cms-pages        → CRUD /cms/pages
 *   inventory        → GET /inventory/options, /available-stock, /low-stock, /history
 *                      POST /inventory/adjustments
 *   pos-transactions → GET /pos/booking/bookings, /pos/booking/bookings/:id
 *                      POST /pos/booking/bookings/:id/payments (fullAccess —
 *                      collecting a partial-payment installment)
 *                      GET /pos/booking/payment-modes also accepts this
 *                      module's view level (or admin-booking's) — see
 *                      requirePaymentModeAccess() in controllers/pos
 *   pos-order-confirmation → GET /pos-order-confirmation/pending, /pending/:referenceId
 *                      POST /pos-order-confirmation/:referenceId/confirm (fullAccess —
 *                      manually confirming a PayNow/NETS payment that hasn't
 *                      had its real bank/terminal confirmation arrive)
 *   print-split-setting → GET/PUT /masters/print-split-setting — singleton,
 *                      decides Deity Wise vs Print Group Wise POS ticket
 *                      printing (see models/print-split-settings)
 *   reports          → GET  /reports/sources
 *                      POST /reports/run, /reports/definitions/:id/run
 *                      GET  /reports/export
 *                      CRUD /reports/definitions (fullAccess — saving/
 *                      deleting a report definition; view is enough to run
 *                      an ad-hoc or already-saved report)
 *
 * Level semantics, applied consistently by every route:
 *   view       → read-only (GET)
 *   edit       → modify something that already exists (PUT)
 *   fullAccess → bring into or remove from existence (POST, DELETE), and
 *                any operation that changes who can do what
