/**
 * Inventory Reservation — a temporary hold placed when a cart/order is
 * created, released either when:
 *  (a) the order is confirmed   → reservation is marked "consumed"
 *  (b) 30 minutes elapse        → reservation is marked "expired" by the
 *                                  cleanup job and the held quantity is
 *                                  returned to the pool
 *  (c) the order is cancelled   → same as (b), but immediate
 *
 * The hold is a SOFT lock on Item/Service.currentStock. The real stock is
 * NOT decremented at order creation — only at confirmation. What IS
 * decremented at order creation is the "available for new reservations"
 * calculation:
 *
 *   available = currentStock
 *             - SUM(active reservation quantities for this ref)
 *
 * This is computed at booking time by the summary endpoint and re-checked
 * atomically inside createOrder. The 30-minute TTL ensures a crashed or
 * abandoned session never permanently consumes stock.
 *
 * NOTE: this model intentionally does NOT use auditablePlugin — these are
 * transient operational records, not master data. They carry their own
 * minimal index set and no soft-delete.
