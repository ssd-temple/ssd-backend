/**
 * The POS counter's own payment-history ledger — the `pos_` counterpart to
 * models/transactions, one row per payment attempt against a PosBooking.
 * `bookingId` is deliberately not unique-constrained, same reason as the
 * shared Transaction model: a full-payment confirm writes one row, and the
 * partial-payment flow appends further rows as the balance is collected. A
 * booking's amountPaid is never stored redundantly — always the sum of its
 * "paid" rows, computed at read time.
 *
 * Unlike the shared Transaction model (which only ever needed
 * paid|pending|refunded because Cash was the only mode, settled
 * synchronously), this ledger has a genuine async pending -> paid/failed
 * lifecycle for PayNow/NETS: a row is written PENDING, with its amount
 * already fixed, the moment a QR is generated (see controllers/payments/
 * paynow/generate-qr) — never re-created, and never re-priced later. The
 * confirmation step (a real DBS ICN, or an admin's manual confirm — see
 * controllers/pos-order-confirmation) only ever flips this SAME row from
 * pending to paid; it does not get to choose a different amount, the same
 * way a Cash cashier can't "confirm" a receipt for more than what was rung
 * up. `gatewayReference` is what makes that flip idempotent: whatever the
 * bank/terminal hands back (DBS txnRefId, a NETS terminal reference) so a
 * duplicate callback for an already-settled row is recognizable and safely
 * ignored rather than double-counted.
 *
 * `bookingId` is nullable — a PENDING row for an order's FIRST payment is
 * written before any PosBooking exists yet (the booking is only created
 * once that payment is actually confirmed, same as Cash's own confirm-time
 * write), and gets backfilled onto this same row at that point. A PENDING
 * row for a balance top-up on an already-confirmed booking has it from the
 * start.

  // order (the first payment AND every later top-up), never reused across
  // them. This — not PosOrder.referenceId — is what actually gets embedded
  // in the PayNow QR / sent to the NETS terminal, and what
  // confirmPosPayment looks the pending row up by directly. Reusing one
  // order-level reference across multiple sequential PayNow/NETS attempts
  // was the original design and turned out to be a real problem: a bank/
  // terminal can refuse, or mis-reconcile, a second live payment carrying a
  // reference it already saw settle once — see confirmPosPayment's own
