/**
 * Every sub-router is mounted under an explicit path prefix, and that is a
 * correctness requirement rather than tidiness.
 *
 * A router mounted with no prefix is entered by Express for *any* path that
 * reaches this file, so its router-level middleware runs on unrelated
 * requests. That already broke things twice here: an unauthenticated
 * `/health` started returning 401 from the admin routers' `authGuard`, and
 * later `/me/customer-profile` returned "restricted to temple
 * administrators" because it fell through the same routers' `adminOnly`
 * before ever reaching the customer routes. Both times the symptom pointed
 * at the wrong file entirely.
 *
 * With prefixes, `router.use(authGuard, adminOnly)` inside a sub-router
 * applies to that sub-router's paths and nothing else.
 */

/**
 * `authGuard` + `adminOnly` applied ONCE here, for the whole group — not
 * inside each individual master's own controller file.
 *
 * Every master under /masters (and both routers under /notifications) used
 * to call `router.use(authGuard, adminOnly)` at its own top. That looked
 * safe in isolation, but every one of those routers is mounted at the exact
 * same prefix below, and Express doesn't stop at the first one that doesn't
 * match a route — it falls through to the next `router.use("/masters", X)`
 * in this list. `authGuard` and `adminOnly` are still just middleware, and
 * middleware attached via a path-less `router.use()` runs for *any* request
 * that reaches that router, whether or not that router turns out to have a
 * matching route. So a single request to `GET /masters/items` was running
 * `authGuard` — a real database round-trip to re-read the account and its
 * roles — once for every OTHER masters router mounted before `itemRoutes`
 * in this list, not once. With thirteen routers sharing the /masters
 * prefix, that's up to twelve wasted database round-trips before the
 * request ever reached the code that actually answers it, and it only got
 * worse the later a master sits in this list (Payment Mode, last in line,
 * paid for all twelve of the others). Grouping the shared prefix under one
 * router with the guard applied once fixes this for every master at once,
 * structurally, rather than needing to remember it per file.
 *
 * `/users`, `/roles`, and `/customers` are NOT part of this — each of those
 * is the only router mounted at its prefix, so they never had this problem,
 * and keep their own `authGuard`/`adminOnly` exactly as before.
